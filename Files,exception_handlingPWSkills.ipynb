        "* **Interpretation Process**: In an interpreted language , the code is translated into machine code line-by-line by an interpreter during execution. There is no separate compilation step that produces a stand-alone executable file. The interpreter reads the source code and executes it directly.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. **Exception handling** in Python is a mechanism that allows you to deal with runtime errors in a controlled way. Rather than letting your program crash when an error occurs,Python provides tools to catch and handle exceptions so that your program can recover,display meaningful error messages , or take alternative actions.\n",
        "Here is how exception handling works in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Try-Except Block**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **try**:You place the code that might cause an exception inside the try block.\n",
        "* **except**: If an exception occurs inside the **try** block, the program immediately jumps to the **except** block,where you can define how to handle the exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Multiple Except Clauses:**\n",
        "* You can have multiple **except** clauses to catch different types of exceptions and handle them accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Else Block**\n",
        "* The **else** block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the **try** block . It allows you to define code that should run only when the **try** block executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Finally Block**:\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. The **finally** block in exception handling in Python is used to define code that always gets executed ,regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This ensures that certain cleanup opeartions or necessary final actions are performed, such as closing files, releasing resources or resetting variables, even if an error occured during execution of the **try** block.\n",

It provides a flexible framework for writing log messages that can help you monitor,debug, and maintain your code. Instead of using **print()** statements for debugging or tracking purposes, Python's built-in **logging** module provides a more robust , scalable and configurable approach.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. In Python, the __del__ method is a special method that is known as **destructor**. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed i.e. , when it is garbage collected. This method allows you to define cleanup actions for the object, such as closing files, releasing resources or performing other necessary finalization tasks before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Automatic Invocation**: The __del__ method is automatically called when the object's reference count reaches zero, which means there are no more references to the object and it is eligible for garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Resource Cleanup:** You can use the __del__ method to release resources like file habdles, network connections that the object might have acquired during its lifetime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **limited Control Over execution**: Since the __del__ method is called when an object is garbage collected, its execution is managed by Python's garbage collector.\n",

        "4. **Persitent Log History**\n",

        "1. **Reference Counting**\n",
        "The primary method for memory management in Python is **reference Counting**. This means Python keeps track of how many references exist to each object in memory. Each time an object is reffered , its reference count increases. When the reference count drops to zero, the object can be safely deleted and its memory freed.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Issue**: Python's garbage collector uses a reference-counting mechanism to track the number of references to an object. When an object’s reference count drops to zero, it is freed. But in the case of circular references (e.g., two objects referencing each other), reference counting alone can't handle memory release. The garbage collector is meant to handle this, but it isn't always perfect.\n",
        "* **Solution**: Developers can use the gc module to control and manually trigger garbage collection. Understanding how to avoid circular references and using weak references can help minimize problems with GC.\n",

Circular references (e.g., objects referring to each other in a cycle) can sometimes go unnoticed and aren't freed by the GC automatically.\n",

        "* **Scenario:** In applications with a graphical user interface (GUI), like desktop applications or web apps, long-running tasks (e.g., file processing or data fetching) could make the interface unresponsive, leading to a poor user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Benefit:**By using multithreading, you can run time-consuming tasks in the background while keeping the user interface responsive. This allows users to interact with the program while other tasks are being performed.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Scenario:** Some applications require intensive computation (CPU-bound tasks), such as simulations, data analysis, or machine learning. Multithreading can divide a large task into smaller ones, allowing the application to perform computations in parallel on multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Benefit:** For applications that perform tasks that can be split into independent subtasks, multithreading helps maximize CPU utilization by allowing multiple threads to run in parallel, thus speeding up processing times."
